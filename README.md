## About Saphyra
Saphyra is a high-performance Python-based research tool designed to simulate DDoS attack patterns. It allows security professionals, researchers, and penetration testers to understand network congestion, packet floods, and the overall impact of volumetric attacks.

### Key Features
- **Simulates HTTP flooding** using randomized user-agents
- **Multi-threaded request generation** for high request throughput
- **Configurable target selection** (URL, host, port)
- **Custom header injection** to evade basic filtering
- **Lightweight and fast execution**
